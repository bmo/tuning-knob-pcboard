All connections to a computer will be made by connecting a micro-USB cable to the STM-32 board, the other end into your computer/device.

# RemoteHamRadio

In order to use the board with RemoteHamRadio, you'll need to set it up like it is a FlexControl. 

Go to the devices tab on the bottom left-hand side. Go to the tab labeled FlexControl, click discover COM port, and then quickly unplug and re-plug in the USB cable for the device. RHR should detect the correct port and you'll be good to go to start using the VFO knob and tuning the bands.

# SmartSDR

SmartSDR from Flex Radio should automatically detect the device, but sometimes it doesn't grab it right away. I've found that simply unplugging it, plugging it back in, and waiting around 20 seconds gets it to be recognized. From here, you'll automatically be able to start using it as a VFO knob.

If you want to change the features of the buttons, or clicking down on the knob, simply go to the tab at the top of the screen labeled Settings, and then click FlexControl. If the board is successfully connected, you'll be able to change the settings here.
